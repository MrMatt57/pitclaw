[![CI](https://github.com/MrMatt57/pitclaw/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MrMatt57/pitclaw/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Open-source BBQ temperature monitor and controller. Uses an ESP32-S3 with a 3.5" touchscreen to maintain precise smoker temperature via PID-controlled fan and optional servo damper. Reads Thermoworks-compatible thermistor probes. Includes a web interface (PWA) for remote monitoring from any phone or computer on Wi-Fi. Touchscreen works fully offline.

### Touchscreen Dashboard

Real-time temperature display on the 3.5" capacitive touchscreen. Works fully offline — no Wi-Fi required.

### Web Interface

Browser-based PWA with live temperature graph, predictive done-time curves, and full cook session control. Access from any device at `http://bbq.local`.

## Features

- **3 probe inputs**: 1 pit (ambient) + 2 meat probes (Thermoworks Pro-Series compatible, 2.5mm jack)
- **PID temperature control**: Fan + optional damper hold pit temperature steady (±5°F typical)
- **3.5" capacitive touchscreen**: Real-time dashboard — works fully without Wi-Fi
- **Web UI (PWA)**: Install to home screen, real-time graph, set points, alarms, session export
- **Predictive curve**: Chart shows dashed projection from current meat temp to target with estimated done time
- **Alarms**: Local buzzer + browser audio + Pushover push notifications
- **Cook session logging**: Persists through power loss, download as CSV/JSON before starting next cook
- **Easy setup**: QR code on screen for Wi-Fi, captive portal, mDNS (`bbq.local`)
- **OTA updates**: Flash new firmware from the browser — no USB after initial setup
- **Error detection**: Probe disconnect/short, fire-out warning, Wi-Fi auto-reconnect
- **Calibration**: Per-probe Steinhart-Hart coefficients with offset adjustment
- **3D printable enclosure**: PETG case with snap-fit assembly

## Hardware

### Bill of Materials

All internal electronics mount on a single 50x70mm carrier perfboard behind the display. Requires basic soldering (~20 joints). Enclosure target is ~100x70x40mm.

### Temperature Probes (buy separately)

Any Thermoworks Pro-Series probe with 2.5mm mono jack works:
- [TX-1003X-AP](https://www.thermoworks.com/tx-1003x-ap/) — Air/pit probe with grate clip (~$19)
- [TX-1001X-OP](https://www.thermoworks.com/tx-1001x-op/) — Cooking/meat probe (~$21)

Compatible alternatives: Maverick ET-72/73 replacement probes (different Steinhart-Hart coefficients), Inkbird, FireBoard probes.

### 3D Printed Parts

All parametric [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) (free) source files in `enclosure/`. Pre-exported STLs in `enclosure/stl/` if you just want to print. See the [enclosure README](enclosure/README.md) for print settings and assembly instructions.

**Controller enclosure** (`bbq-case.scad`) — three parts:
- **Front bezel** — holds display, bezel lip frames the screen
- **Rear shell** — houses carrier board, panel-mount jacks, cable slots, ventilation
- **Kickstand** — detachable flip-out stand
- Target size: ~100 x 70 x 40mm
- Assembly: 4x M3x8mm screws

**Fan + damper assembly** (`bbq-fan-assembly.scad`) — two parts:
- **Blower housing** — holds 5015 fan, MG90S servo, butterfly damper plate
- **UDS pipe adapter** — friction-fits over 3/4" NPT pipe nipple, secured with hose clamp
- Airflow: outside air → damper → fan → duct → pipe adapter → drum
- The blower housing output is a standard round duct — future adapters for other smokers (WSM, kamado, offset) mate to the same interface

**Print settings** (both):
- Material: PETG (80°C glass transition, resists outdoor heat and grease)
- 4 walls, 30%+ infill, 0.2mm layers, no supports needed

**Additional hardware for assembly:**
- 4x M3x8mm screws + threaded inserts (controller case)
- 2x small hose clamps (fan assembly to pipe, adapter to pipe nipple)
- High-temp gasket tape (seal adapter to pipe nipple)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Set Up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrMatt57/pitclaw.git
cd pitclaw
```

**Windows** — one script installs everything (Git, Python, PlatformIO CLI, OpenSCAD):

```powershell
# Run from an elevated (Admin) PowerShell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup-dev.ps1
```

**Other platforms** — install [PlatformIO CLI](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html) (`pip install platformio`).

### 2. Wire and Assemble

Solder the carrier board and wire everything up. See the [wiring guide](docs/wiring.md) for the full diagram and pin assignments.

### 3. Build and Flash

```bash
cd firmware

# Build firmware
pio run -e wt32_sc01_plus

# Connect WT32-SC01 Plus via USB-C, then flash
pio run -e wt32_sc01_plus --target upload

# Upload web UI files to flash filesystem
pio run -e wt32_sc01_plus --target uploadfs
```

After this initial flash, all future firmware updates can be done over Wi-Fi at `http://bbq.local/update`.

### 4. First Boot

1. Power on — the setup wizard starts on the touchscreen
2. Select temperature units (°F or °C)
3. Scan the QR code on screen with your phone to connect to the setup Wi-Fi
4. Enter your home Wi-Fi credentials in the portal page
5. Plug in probes — the wizard verifies live readings
6. Fan, servo, and buzzer do a quick self-test
7. Setup complete — dashboard appears

### 5. Use the Web UI

Open `http://bbq.local` in any browser on the same Wi-Fi network.

For the best experience, add it to your phone's home screen (it's a PWA):
- **iOS**: Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen
- **Android**: Chrome → Menu → Add to Home Screen

### Factory Reset

Hold your finger on the touchscreen for 10 seconds during the boot splash screen.
